Good practice to use spread operator to ensure no mutation of the state. Spread operator is used on a set variablt and then returned as shown below.


const immutableReducer = (state = ['Do not mutate state!'], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TO_DO':
      // Don't mutate state here or the tests will fail
      let addToDoState = [...state, action.todo];
      return addToDoState
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addToDo = (todo) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TO_DO',
    todo
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
