to remove the index, we RETURN [] two new array slices (before and after the index position), and then they are already a new array. Could also take each slice and concat them together to form a new array 


const immutableReducer = (state = [0,1,2,3,4,5], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'REMOVE_ITEM':
      // Don't mutate state here or the tests will fail
      return [
        ...state.slice(0, action.index),
        ...state.slice(action.index + 1, state.length)
      ]
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const removeItem = (index) => {
  return {
    type: 'REMOVE_ITEM',
    index
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
